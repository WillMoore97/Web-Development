# Web-Development
A basic web application that i developed as part of my University degree

In this application, the following is demonstrated:
Using Node.JS as the template engine
Developing a CSS without the use of a bootstrap template
Using a NoSQL database with the mongoose schema method.
Similarly using the mongoose scheme to push data with a rest API.
